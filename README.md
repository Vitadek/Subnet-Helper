# Subnet-Helper
This program takes two inputs, an IP address and a cidr - then will calculate how many usable addresses are available (subtracting NetworkID and Broadcast IP) as well as IP range (unsegmented)
This Program is for School - but someone might have some use for it. It's a custom APK so your file manager might have some issues with you trying to install it.
